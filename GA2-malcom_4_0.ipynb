    "    2. PM particles, either PM_10 or PM_2.5 are so small they can damage the tissue in the lungs and cause lung inflammation.\n",

This will have a high probability to also show in the data of the other points, since the concentration has a higher variability then the winds speed, mainly because the wind speed is averaged over an period of 10 minutes.

However, on the other hand, it can be argued for the null hypothesis by the fact that although there is a trend between both variables this can be due to another factor. For instance, high wind speeds might cause lower temperature which in turn causes lower concentrations of NOx.
